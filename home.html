        <h1>These are the projects I have done so far</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Choi-R/FirstTime" target="_blank" title="github.com/Choi-R/FirstTime">Kahoot-Like</a></h3></li>
            <p>This is my very first project and my very first step into the web development world with javascript. It's not anything fancy, just my way of learning javascript, http, and git in one go. Anyway, like the name implies, this project is about the user answering a set of quiz with 10 questions by choosing one of the multiple choices.</p>
            <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Choi-R/IMDB-like" target="_blank" title="github.com/Choi-R/IMDB-like">Movie Review</a></h3></li>
            <p>This is a team-based project. At the time we created this project, we're already using Heroku, a serverless cloud hosting, and deploy it through Gitlab CI/CD. This project enlist many kind of movies. There are also register and login for user to give a review to a movie and rate it from 1 to 5. My responsibility is the review API.</p>
            <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Choi-R/At-Your-Service" target="_blank" title="github.com/Choi-R/At-Your-Service">At Your Service (AYS)</a></h3></li>
            <p>This is my final project in Glints Academy, quite a full scale one if I may say. AYS is mobile-based app, a platform for the startups in Indonesia. Using AYS, the users can browse through our list of startups and propose a partnership, while the startup owner can register his/her business here to attract more attention. This app also provide daily news and article about startup. I'm in charge of business and inquiry API.</p>
            <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Choi-R/chat-app" target="_blank" title="github.com/Choi-R/chat-app">Chat App</a></h3></li>
            <p>Finished from Glints Academy doesn't mean my learning is also finished. After graduation, I keep sharpening my logic and skills. In this project, I tried to learn about web socket because I might be tasked to create a chat box or something like that in the future. I create this project based on socket.io's "Getting Started".</p>
            <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Choi-R/first-php" target="_blank" title="github.com/Choi-R/first-php">A School's Website (Indonesia)</a></h3></li>
            <p>As much as I want to dig deeper into Javascript, I keep getting question like "why do you use Javascript?". My answer is, I won't sugarcoat it, "because that's what I was being taught on web development". To seek further meaning on that question, I embark on a new journey into the world of PHP language. For now I'm using CodeIgniter as my choice framework (again, I keep getting question "why CodeIgniter?". I don't have any good answer right now). This project is about me creating a typical school's website in Indonesia, mainly a database for the students and teachers' data.</p>
